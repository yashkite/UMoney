# UMoney
This project is based on money management for anyone who like the 20-30-50 rule. we will add a coustom percentage option in future and also track the money with automation built in

In future we like to add AI & Machine Lerning powered app to give the best advice based on current transaction history.

this project is a very very initial stage, the main objective of this project is that we are going to create very useful money tracking and investing app which will track all money of a user and investment (like IND Money) and can be configured that how it's going to spend in term of a set percentage which will be configured by the user.


I have the idea in my mind but do not have any coding knowledge. that's why I'm doing this open-source project. the main objective is that it will simplify not only investing calculation but also introduce new features like finding a food in budget and with the help of the community we can come up with good ideas and implement very quickly.
