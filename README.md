## About The Project
This project is based on money management for anyone who likes the **20-30-50 rule**. The main objective of this project is that we are going to create a very useful **money tracking and investing app** which will track all money of a user and investment (like IND Money) and can be configured that how it's going to spend in terms of a set percentage which will be configured by the user also with manual entry system (like Khatabook).

> Why we are doing this.

### Here's why:
#### IND Money 
- doesn't come with manual entry of the transaction
- doesn't track UPI transactions
- does not update the Bank Balance amount in real-time.

#### Khatabook
- The entry process takes too much time
- Every entry is done manually


 

### Built With
- Java / Kotlin
- XML
- Python
